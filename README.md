## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflowframework


### What I learned

I've learned more of using CSS efficiently with sizing for responsiveness and breakpoints. After looking around for some tips I stumbled on reddit someone suggesting to use em/rem for most sizing instead of px because the elements scale better. After looking this up some more to validate it I applied that to this project I feel like it came out great. I actually understand em and rem sizing now instead of throwing in random numbers.

This lesson was a big upgrade for me with the @media quiries as well with the added challenge of reshaping the whole model around based on page size.

### Continued development

I'll continue to push my skills with Flexbox, I believe i will be doing the mobile first approach then breakpointing for desktop after on projects. It felt more natural and easier to work around

### Useful resources

Codecademy.com was big help when i needed to refer to my lessons there.
